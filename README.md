<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üëâ About The Project

This Capstone Project was completely built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it is the final project for React/Redux course.

The purpose of this project is to present a proposal of a catalog React/Redux single application that fetch data from an external API. 
You should be able to filter the received data and access to the details of the selected item.  

To make this happen, the app should use client side routes for displaying the details of the apps pages.

The complete project's assignment can be seen [here](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Recipes-ea589778a95f47fa98034d99d4016d2b).

## üëâ Gamma Gallery

Gamma gallery is my proposal for the required assignments. It consists in a catalog of photos taken by the land rovers that inhabits mars, the chosen API is the NASA Open APIs Mars Rover Photos and the client side router used is React Router Dom. 
The style of the catalog its a minimalistic monochromatic one, giving importance and protagonism to the black and white photographs.

### üëâ Landing Page

In Gamma Gallery the pages are generated dynamically by choosing the preferred rover and the martian day after clicking on the navigation bar's seen button.
You can choose between different options.

    For Rovers you have:
    
      *  Curiosity.
      *  Opportunity.
      *  Spirit.  
      
    For martian days you can choose:
    
      *  From day one to the one thousand.

### üëâ Gallery Catalog

After choosing between the options and clicking the see button, a menu will be displayed with the information of the chosen data and the cameras filter, the data includes the rover, the day and the last visited photograph.
The cameras filter it's upgrated every time that you ask for a different rover, and you will be able to filter photos by the current rover's cameras.

The photos are presented on the screen with a label below them, the text shown is the photo's ID uniq number.  
Every photo can be clicked in order to get the data details of every one of them.
It's this link the one that uses the client side route that will display the corresponding photo's data.
